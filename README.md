# Bas Koekkoek, Currency Converter

## Note to reviewer

For the state management in this project I have used Redux. The main reason for this was that I wanted to show my capabilities in this technology, but I am aware that the use of Redux is not necessary. The state management could, in a relatively simple app like this, have been done in a local state using React Hooks.

## What is this app about?

This app is a currency converter.

## What technologies and concepts are used in this project?

- React
- Redux
- Typescript
- [Exchange Rates Api](https://exchangeratesapi.io/)

## User Stories

- Ability to select the source and target currencies
- Ability to input the source amount
- Conversion rates must be pulled from a third-party API. We recommend using https://ratesapi.io/, but other APIs may be used as well, however the actual conversion calculation must be performed by your application (also do not use any third-party libraries for it).

- Ability to perform multiple conversions at the same time
- Option to select a different date for the conversion rate
- Bidirectional conversion (user can input either source or target amount)
